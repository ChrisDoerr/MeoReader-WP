Introduction
============

The internet is full of information: Blogs, news sites, podcasts, magazines,
forums, event calendars,... you name it.

Via RSS you can subscribe to almost all of these entities so you wouldn't
have to visit each website every day, maybe even multiple times a day.

Instead, you can manage your RSS feeds in a single application, just like
the meoReader. It will collect all the latest content and lets you read
it in one single place.



Why WordPress?
==============

Hosting your own web-based RSS feed reader application makes it possible
for you to have access from all sorts of devices (e.g. a desktop computer,
a mobile phone, a tablet pc or maybe even a gaming console) and don't having
to worry about synchronization.

Sure, there are service providers that will do that hosting for you.
But can you rely on these services to always be there? Even the Google Reader
was put to end!

Installing a web application on a distant server can be painful,
nerve-wracking and time consuming if you want to keep the software up-to-date.

The meoReader is a WordPress plugin and therefore can be installed, maintained
and updated just like any other plugin!

Chances are you already have a WordPress installation. So adding the meoReader
there and hosting your own RSS feed Reader application is only a matter of a
few clicks!

ones on facebook, twitter or via email. You can also create blog posts from
entries or store them in an archive if you want to.

The meoReader can boost your productivity, safe you time and therefore maybe
money. Let it be your one single place to keep up with all your favorite or
professional topics of interest.
